I like black and white\
*Dreaming of black and white*\
You like black and white\
Run, runaway\
See chameleon\
*Lying there in the sun*\
All thanks to everyone\
Run, runaway

If you're in the swing\
*Money ain't everything*\
If you're in the swing\
Run, runaway\
See chameleon\
*Lying there in the sun*\
All thanks to everyone\
Run, runaway

If you got a crush\
*Don't beat about the bush*\
When I got a crush\
Run, runaway\
See chameleon\
*Lying there in the sun*\
All thanks to everyone\
Run, runaway

***Interlude***

Oh, now can't you wait?\
*Love don't come on a plate*\
Oh, now can't you wait?\
Run, runaway\
See the chameleon\
*Lying there in the sun*\
All thanks to everyone\
Run, runaway
