title: "Leaving of Liverpool"
---

*(Traditional sea shanty)*

Farewell to Princess landing stage, River Mersey, fare-thee-well\
I am bound for California\
A place I know right well

\*Â  **So, fare-thee-well, my own true love\
When I return, united we will be\
It's not the leaving of Liverpool that grieves me\
But my darling, when I think of thee**

I have sailed with Burgess once before\
I think I know him well\
If a man's a sailor, he will get along\
If not, then he's sure in hell

\*

Farewell to Lower Frederick Street\
Anson Terrace and Park Lane\
I am bound away for to leave you\
And I'll never see you again

\*
