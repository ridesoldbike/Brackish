title: "All for Me Grog"

*Traditional Seafaring Song*

\
I'm sick in the head and I haven't been to bed,\
Since first I came ashore with me plunder,\
I've seen centipedes and snakes and me head is full of aches,\
And I have to take a path for way out yonder.\
\
**And, it's all for me grog, me jolly, jolly grog,\
It's all for me beer and tobacco,\
Well I spent all me tin with the lassies drinking gin.\
Far across the western ocean I must wander.**\
\
Where are me boots, me noggin', noggin' boots?\
They're all sold for beer and tobacco,\
For the heels they were worn out and the toes were kicked about,\
And the soles were looking out for better weather.\
\
**And, it's all for me grog, me jolly, jolly grog,\
It's all for me beer and tobacco,\
Well I spent all me tin with the lassies drinking gin.\
Far across the western ocean I must wander.**\
\
Where is me shirt, me noggin', noggin' shirt?\
It's all sold for beer and tobacco,\
For the collar was all worn, and the sleeves they were all torn,\
And the tail was looking out for better weather.\
\
**And, it's all for me grog, me jolly, jolly grog,\
It's all for me beer and tobacco,\
Well I spent all me tin with the lassies drinking gin.\
Far across the western ocean I must wander.**\
\
I'm sick in the head and I haven't been to bed,\
Since first I came ashore from me slumber,\
For I spend all me dough on the lassies don't you know,\
Far across the western ocean I must wander.

**And, it's all for me grog, me jolly, jolly grog,\
It's all for me beer and tobacco,\
Well I spent all me tin with the lassies drinking gin.\
Far across the western ocean I must wander.**\
