And like the sea, we always welcome new friends with their instruments and voices.\nWe play the first Thursday of the month at North Channel Brewery. We just love to play jigs and reels in the corner but do request a bar song! Then raise a glass and join us in song.\nSongs we know are found in the top left corner titled “lyrics”"
