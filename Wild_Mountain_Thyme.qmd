title: "Wild Mountain Thyme"
---

*(Scottish/Irish Folk Song)*

Oh, the summertime is coming,\
And the trees are sweetly blooming,\
And the wild mountain thyme\
Grows around the blooming heather.

\* **Will you go, lassie go?\
And we'll all go together\
To pull wild mountain thyme\
All around the blooming heather,\
Will you go, lassie, go?**

I will build my love a bower\
By yon clear and crystal fountain,\
And all around the bower,\
I'll pile flowers from the mountain.

\*

If my true love eâ€™er should leave me,\
I will surely find another\
Where the wild mountain thyme\
grows around the blooming heather.

\*

Oh, the autumn-time is coming,\
And the leaves are gently falling,\
Where the wild mountain thyme\
Grows around the blooming heather.

\*
