title: "The Galway Girl"
---

*By Steve Earle and Sharon Shannon*

Well, I took a stroll on the old long walk

On a day-i-ay-i-ay

I met a little girl and we stopped to talk

Of a fine soft day-i-ay

And I ask you, friend, what's a fella to do?

Because her hair was black and her eyes were blue

And I knew right then, I'd be taking a whirl

Around the Salthill prom with a Galway girl

\

We were halfway there when the rain came down

On a day-i-ay-i-ay

She asked me up to her flat downtown

Of a fine soft day-i-ay

And I ask you, friend, what's a fella to do?

Because her hair was black and her eyes were blue

And I took her hand and I give her a twirl

And I lost my heart to a Galway girl\
\

When I woke up, I was all alone

With a broken heart and a ticket home

And I ask you now, tell me what would you do?

If her hair was black and her eyes were blue?

Cause Iâ€™ve traveled around

and been all over this world.

Boys, I ain't never seen nothing like a Galway girl
